Simple Exploratory Data Analysis of a provided dataset

#### Project 2

The question of interest is whether or not hook-billed kites are equal in size. This is done using two measurements: `tail` length and `wing` length. We examine the mean vector, containing both measurements, for both male and female hook-billed kites to answer this question. 

We begin with exploratory data analysis. We look at summary statistics and visualization of the data to compare both male and female populations. Next we conduct hypothesis testing to test for equality of male and female mean vectors. Then we construct a 95% confidence region and simultaneuos confidence intervals for the difference in the two mean vectors. Lastly, we state out conclusions.

#### Project 3

We will study the undergraduate grade point average (`GPA`) and graduate management aptitude test (`GMAT`) scores of students from three schools. The question of interest is whether the mean `GPA` and mean `GMAT` scores differ between the three schools. 

In the Material and Methods section, we list the formulas used to arrive at a conclusion; Included in this section is EDA performed on the dataset. MANOVA is used to perform hypothesis testing. Simultaneous confidence intervals are constructed. 

In the Results section, the results from the Materials and Methods section are summarized. Outputs from the Materials and Methods section are used to explain the final results.

#### Project 4

Given the `tail length` (mm) and `snout to vent length` (mm),  we would like to develop classification rules for the `gender` of Concho Water Snakes. 

In the Material and Methods section, we apply linear discriminant analysis on a data set of $n= 66$ observations to develop these classification rules. Here we assume the observations come from multivariate normal distributions with a common variance-covariance matrix, have equal prior probabilities, and have equal costs of misclassification. Additionally in this section, we state the Classification Rule. For this classification rule, we determine the confusion matrix and Apparent Error Rate (APER). Additionally for this classification rule, we determine the confusion matrix using the holdout procedure. 

Finally, in the Results section we state our conclusions.
